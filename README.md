# End-to-End-IoT-Telemetry-Analytics-Pipeline-using-Azure-Databricks-Power-BI-project-03
End-to-end real-time IoT telemetry analytics pipeline built on Azure, leveraging Event Hub for streaming ingestion, Databricks Structured Streaming for transformation, Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2 for scalable storage, and Power BI for interactive visualization, enabling near real-time device monitoring and analytics.

# Real-Time IoT Telemetry Analytics Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time IoT data analytics pipeline built on Azure cloud services.

Telemetry data from simulated IoT devices is ingested through Azure Event Hub, processed using Azure Databricks Structured Streaming, stored in Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2, and visualized through Power BI dashboards.
